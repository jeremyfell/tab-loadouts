Bugs

Add css so all of page text cannot be selected, except in inputs
Tabbing away from an input quickly allows an invalid value to be considered valid


Difficult to add new tab loadouts, as copy and pasting multiple links cannot be done without closing the popup
Possibly move options to a separate options page
