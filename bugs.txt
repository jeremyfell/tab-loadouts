Bugs

Test on keypress to validate instead
Must test for current input + key just pressed


Add css so all of page text cannot be selected, except in inputs
Tabbing away from an input quickly allows an invalid value to be considered valid


Difficult to add new tab loadouts, as copy and pasting multiple links cannot be done without closing the popup
Possibly move options to a separate options page




Todo
Move options to separate options page
Add settings tab
  - Toggle between replacing tabs and adding tabs when a tab loadout is used
Add edit tab functionality
